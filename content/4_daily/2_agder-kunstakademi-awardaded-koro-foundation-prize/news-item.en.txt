Intro: Artworks from the  07.11 Workshop now online at the blackboard.

Continued: We had a discussion around the word apply and I think it sends the wrong message as we don’t have a process of application but more will select our students in dialogue with the prison. We checked out some other academies and for example the one in Tromsø has “Om oss”, “About us” which I think is more inviting and can contain both the information directed at potential students, firstly, and then a link to more formal information about the whole project. It could just me “about” in english without the “us”. Maybe it could have subcategories “For students / For studenter” and “Agder Art Academy / Agder Kunstakademi” for example? Or it should just all come in one bulk and people from outside who want to find out info will just find it out in the same way as potential students, I think that could be nice anyway. Our focus is on them like any other school.
