Title: Invisible Boundaries

----

Agendatxt:

A border is drawn between two opposites; between one thing and another, between here and there or us and them. Borders can be physical limitations of space or territory, but they can also be symbolic definitions of identity, class and belonging. As well as those defined by society, we each have our personal experiences of boundaries. They can protect, but also exclude. They limit but liberate at the same time. Borders define us as much as we define them. 

To an architect, a wall is a typical form of limitation, barrier or enclosure that defines one room from another. But the wall could also be a space in itself, a meeting point between what is inside and outside. A wall can consist of several layers, or be folded to create niches and private spaces. It can have depth and provide seating, or be a place to read a book.

When the architects designed Agder Prison it began with an idea, and understanding of what a border should represent in our society today. Their task was then to translate this understanding into drawing, where every line represents a border, a division of space or area. Agder Kunstakademiâ€™s classroom is one of the spaces that were drawn based on this perception of what a border is in Norway today. 

Within the four walls of the classroom, we will construct our own walls and ourselves shape the boundaries that define the art academy. What does it mean to inhabit this space, and what will take place here? How can these walls that we will build together give space for new activities and experiences that separate this place from the rest of the prison?
