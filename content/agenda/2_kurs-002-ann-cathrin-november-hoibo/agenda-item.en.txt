Agendatxt:   Yakisugi (Shou Sugi Ban) Yakisugi is a method of processing wood with flames. Through the process of charring the wood the surface becomes carbonised, waterproof, fire retardant and durable. Yakisugi is a traditional Japanese technique and has become more and more used in architecture and design.   Assignment: Ann Cathrin November Høibo has been commissioned to design the stage curtains for the multi purpose hall at Agder fengsel. The stage curtains will be woven in wool on a digital loom. In the workshop the students are assigned to contribute an element in form of a wooden panel using Yakisugi. The panel will hangs on the top of the stage as an aesthetic element of the whole installation and functionally covers the hanging of the fabric along the ceiling. The panel will have app. Dimensions of 6.5 m x 0.5 m.  Learning: In the class the students will collaboratively learn the Yakisugi technique and practically explore the potential of the craft. Starting from scratch the group will investigate the technique from examples in art and architecture, back to the origin of the material in our nature. Together with the teacher they will collaboratively discuss the qualities of different wood types and its environment, develop ideas for the panel, and learn carpentry from the raw log to the final product using Yakisugi.
